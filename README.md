# ERC1155-Token-Blockchain

### **Project Overview**
**Generated Fantasy NFT** is a blockchain project promoting sustainability through NFTs. It highlights eco-friendly practices like carbon offsetting, water conservation, and sustainable materials using decentralized technologies.

---

### **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**:  
  - JavaScript  
  - Solidity  

- **Tools**:  
  - Hardhat  
  - Pinata (IPFS for decentralized storage with CIDs)  
  - NightCafe & DeviantArt (AI generation for NFT artwork using precise and effective prompts)

---

### **Deployment**
- **Network**: Polygon Amoy (Testnet)  
- **RPC Provider**: Alchemy  
- **Wallet**: MetaMask  

---

### **Toolbox**
- **Pinata**: Decentralized storage for metadata and images via IPFS.  
- **Vanity-ETH**: Generated a custom Ethereum vanity address for deployment.  
- **Faucet**: Funded the vanity ETH account for testnet deployment.  
- **MetaMask**: Used for wallet management and transaction signing.  
- **NightCafe & DeviantArt**: Utilized for AI-generated artwork by crafting effective prompts to produce detailed and aesthetic designs.

---

### **Features**
- **ERC1155 Smart Contract**: Custom-built contract for minting and managing NFTs.  
- **Decentralized Metadata**: Stored on IPFS for immutability and accessibility.  
- **Fantasy Theme**: Represents a collectible of 5 pieces first generation NFT art. 
- **CUSTOMED features**: Added traits, boosts, stats. 
- **Low Gas Costs**: Deployed on the Polygon Amoy network for affordable transactions.  

---

### **What I Did**
- Built and deployed an ERC1155 smart contract on Polygon Amoy using Alchemy RPC.  
- Designed and uploaded metadata and images to IPFS via Pinata.  
- Generated a vanity Ethereum wallet using Vanity-ETH for deployment.  
- Created NFT artwork using **AI tools (NightCafe & DeviantArt)** with tailored prompts for unique, high-quality designs. Ensured the NFT artwork was correctly sized and professionally optimized for the best visual appeal.  
- Integrated MetaMask for secure wallet transactions.  
- Used Hardhat for contract testing and debugging.  

---

### **What I Learned**
- **Smart Contracts**: Learned to write and deploy custom ERC1155 contracts.  
- **Decentralized Storage**: Gained experience with IPFS and Pinata.  
- **Blockchain Deployment**: Mastered deployment with Alchemy and Polygon.  
- **AI Artwork Generation**: Learned to craft effective prompts for AI tools to produce meaningful NFT designs.  
- **Gas Optimization**: Optimized deployment for lower transaction costs.
